# WeaklySupervised-Classification-Benchmark-For-Computational-Pathology
This project benchmarks weakly-supervised deep learning pipelines for whole slide image (WSI) classification in computational pathology, implementing the classical approach cited in the paper using the MNIST dataset instead of cancer datasets.
